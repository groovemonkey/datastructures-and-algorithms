# Splay Tree

This is a cool one -- a caching tree! I can't believe that neither TADM nor CLRS give splay trees more than a very basic paragraph. They seem like they'd really come in handy for real-life applications where data insertion (and especially data access) are not uniform and random.

Thanks to [algorithmtutor](http://algorithmtutor.com/Data-Structures/Tree/Splay-Trees/) for an excellent description and [example code](https://github.com/Bibeknam/algorithmtutorprograms/blob/master/data-structures/splay-trees/splay_tree.py).
